If you want to keep the same URL each time you use ngrok: create a static domain on your dashboard and then use the --url flag to ask the ngrok agent to use it. First, stop ngrok with Ctrl+C and then run ngrok again with your static domain :

       ngrok http 8000 --url=terier-patent-monogoose.ngrok-free.app

if you want to add user and password :

 ngrok http http://localhost:8000 --basic-auth 'sam:Holyshit' --url=terier-patent-monogoose.ngrok-free.app
